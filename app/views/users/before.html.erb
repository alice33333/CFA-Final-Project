<h13> <b>Caution</b>: If you choose to log out or return to your homepage, save the URL of the current team member you are on.
This can be achieved by highlighting the entire address bar, right-clicking, and selecting copy. Paste this URL into a safe place since leaving the evaluation will result in starting over at the beginning of the evaluation. Also, if you are unfamiliar
with a team member or would simply like to skip over them, pressing 'Submit Score' at the bottom of their form will allow
you to continue onto the next employee.</h13>
